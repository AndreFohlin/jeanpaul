You'll need config.js to be able to start this up. Talk to Andr√© or Martin(kvadd) to get this file, and a token.

jeanpaul.js is the main bot file.

To start up the bot, use `node jeanpaul.js` or something like `nodemon jeanpaul.js` or maybe even `forever jeanpaul.js` depending on your preferences.
