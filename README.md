# jeanpaul
You'll need config.js to be able to start this up. Talk to Andr√© or Martin(kvadd) to get this file, and a token.

jeanpaul.js is the main bot file.

To start up the bot use `node jeanpaul.js` or something like `nodemon jeanpaul.js` or maybe even `forever jeanpaul.js` depending on your preferences. This will start up a local version of JP, and you can then test out your very own cat bot locally. The catbot will run along with the original bot as well.
